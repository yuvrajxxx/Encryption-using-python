Encryption & Decryption Program
This is a simple encryption and decryption program written in Python using the tkinter library for the GUI. It allows the user to enter a message and a key, and then encrypt or decrypt the message using a Caesar cipher.

Requirements
This program requires Python 3.x and the tkinter library to be installed.

Usage
To use the program, run the code in a Python interpreter or IDE. A GUI window will appear, where you can enter a message to encrypt or decrypt, and a key to use for the cipher.

To encrypt a message, click the "ENCRYPT" button. The encrypted message will appear in red text on the window.

To decrypt a message, click the "DECRYPT" button. The decrypted message will appear in red text on the window.

Note
This program uses a very simple Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption, and is not meant to provide strong security. It is intended for educational purposes only.
